# AnimalAI Python API

This package provides training libraries for training agents for the Animal AI Olympics competition. It is not required 
to use this as part of submissions, it is however useful for running the [examples provided](../README.md). We provide 
an extension of [Unity's MLAgents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents) as well as 
[dopamine](https://github.com/google/dopamine).

For more details and documentation have a look at the [AnimalAI documentation](../documentation)
